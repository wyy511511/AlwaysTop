## Product Introduction:

This tool is designed for language enthusiasts who want to leverage films as a language-learning resource. When reviewing films with dual-language SRT script files, it's easy to fall into the habit of relying on translations in your native language, which can cause you to overlook the other language you may want to focus onâ€”what is known as shadowing or an "English immersion" environment. This tool helps you utilize films more effectively to enhance your listening skills and broaden your vocabulary.

## Design Inspiration:
Drawing from iPhone's "Dynamic Island," the design offers an interactive and fluid user experience.



Inspired by the traditional physical small notes, which discreetly hide information.
